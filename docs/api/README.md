# 📚 API Documentation

Quick-reference guides for the APIs we use in this project.

---

## 🤖 [Letta AI API](./LETTA_API_REFERENCE.md)

Everything you need to work with Letta's REST API:
- ✅ Tool management (create, update, delete)
- ✅ Agent configuration (attach/detach tools)
- ✅ Common pitfalls & fixes
- ✅ Real-world examples from our testing

**Read:** [LETTA_API_REFERENCE.md](./LETTA_API_REFERENCE.md)

**Key Learnings:**
- `Content-Type: application/json` header is CRITICAL
- Tool `name` goes inside `json_schema`, not top-level
- PATCH /agents requires FULL tool list, not just changes

---

## 💬 [Discord API](./DISCORD_API_REFERENCE.md)

Bot essentials for Discord integration:
- ✅ Sending DMs & channel messages
- ✅ Reading message history
- ✅ Handling attachments
- ✅ Rate limits & error handling
- ✅ Message chunking (2000 char limit)

**Read:** [DISCORD_API_REFERENCE.md](./DISCORD_API_REFERENCE.md)

**Key Learnings:**
- DMs require 2 steps: create channel → send message
- Messages max 2000 chars → chunk longer ones
- Bot token format: `Bot YOUR_TOKEN` (not `Bearer`)

## 🛠️ Why These Docs Exist

During development, we discovered:
- Official docs were scattered or unclear
- Some gotchas weren't documented
- We wasted time on trial-and-error

**This is our "learned the hard way" knowledge base!**

Use these as:
- Quick reference during development
- Error debugging guide
- Foundation for your own projects
